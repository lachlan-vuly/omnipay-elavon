## Basic Usage

The following gateways are provided by this package:

* Converge

```php
<?php
    $gateway = \Omnipay\Omnipay::create('Elavon_Converge')->initialize([
        'merchantId' => '000000',
         'username' => 'USERNAME',
         'password' => 'PASSWORD',
         'testMode' => true,// False by default
    ]);

    $params = array(
        'amount'                => 10.00,
        'card'                  => $card,
        'ssl_invoice_number'    => 1,
        'ssl_show_form'         => 'false',
        'ssl_result_format'     => 'ASCII',
    );

    $response = $gateway->purchase($params)->send();

    if ($response->isSuccessful()) {
        // successful
        $reference = $response->getTransactionReference();
        // ...
    } else {
        throw new ApplicationException($response->getMessage());
    }
```
